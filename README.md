# RayQE (Raydreams Query Engine)

This is purely nostalgia and safe keeping of a something I thought was no big deal at the time. It was 2006 and I'd taken over a project where a previous developer was shipping straight T-SQL over the pipe which no one thought 'hey, that might be really stupid'. Big Corp IT - you gotta love their arrogance that they can do no wrong.

So I came-up with the idea of doing an XML based query library to construct API queries so they could also be stored and shipped about without fear of someone appending it with, you know, ';DROP CorpSecrets'

Nowdays with things like OData and GraphQL - it's no longer relevant but... funny to see how .NET has changed over 15 years especially how XML centric things were back then.

## Specs

Rebuilt as .NET Standard 2.1 but in need of lots of modernization.
